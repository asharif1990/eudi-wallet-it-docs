Relying Party Solution
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes how a Relying Party may ask to a Wallet Instance the presentation of the PID and the (Q)EAAs, according the following specifications: 

- `OpenID for Verifiable Presentations - draft 19 <https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html>`_.
- `Draft: OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop>`_.


In this section the following flows are described:

- **Remote Same Device Flow**, where the Verifier and the Wallet Instance acts in the same device.
- **Remote Cross Device Flow**, where the Verifier and the Wallet Instance acts in different devices and the Verifier is a remote Relying Party.

The flows are analyzed in this chapter, taking into account security and privacy considerations.

.. note::
    Relying Party and Verifier are the same entity.


Remote Protocol Flow
--------------------
In the **Same Device** and **Cross Device** Authorization Flows, the User interacts with a remote Relying Party.
This scenario requests the Verifier to provide the URL where the signed request object is available.

The Verifier MUST detect the device type of the requestor (Wallet Instance), if it is a mobile device or a workstationm and activate one the supported remote flows:

* In the *Same Device** flow the Verifier MUST provide a HTTP redirect (302) location to the Wallet Instance;
* In the *Cross Device** flow the Verifier MUST provide a QR Code which the User frames with their Wallet Instance.

Once the Relying Party authentication is performed by the Wallet Instance, the User gives the consent for the release of the personal data, in the form of a Verifiable Presentation.

Authorization Request Details
-----------------------------
In the Cross Device Flow, a QR Code is shown by the Relying Party to the User in order to issue the Authorization Request.

The User frames the QR Code using the Wallet Instance, then grants the consent to release their attributes to the RP.

The payload of the QR Code is a **Base64 encoded string** based on the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

  eudiw://authorize?client_id=`$client_id`&request_uri=`$request_uri`

In the Same Device Flow the parameter **client_id** and **request_uri** are the same if the ones used in the Cross Device Flow with the only difference about the url schema and the removal of the Verifier's FQDN from the URL.

In the Same Device Flow the Relying Party uses a HTTP response redirect (status code 302) to give to the Wallet Instance the resource where the request object is available for download, as represented in the following non-normative example:


.. code:: text

    HTTP/1.1 /pre-authz-endpoint Found
    Location: eudiw://authorize?
    client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fverifier.example.org%2Fcb
    &request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fverifier.example.org%2Frequest_uri_endpoint

.. note::
    The Same Device flow proposed in this specification is under discussion and must be considered as experimental.

Where:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 50
  :header-rows: 1

  * - **Name**
    - **Description**
  * - **client_id**
    - Client unique identifier of the Verifier.
  * - **request_uri**
    - The Verifier request URI used by the Wallet Instance to retrieve the Request Object.

.. note::
    The *error correction level* chosen for the QR Code MUST be Q (Quartily - up to 25%), since it offers a good balance between error correction capability and data density/space. This level of quality and error correction allow the QR Code to remain readable even if it is damaged or partially obscured.


Below is a non-normative example of a QR Code issued by the Relying Party:

Below is a non-normative example of the QR Code raw payload:

Below follows its Base64 decoded content:

.. code-block:: text

  eudiw://authorize?client_id=https://verifier.example.org&request_uri=https://verifier.example.org/request_uri

Cross Device Flow Security Considerations
-----------------------------------------

When the flow is Cross Device, the user-agent needs to check the session status to an endpoint made available by Relying Party and specialized for this scope. This check MAY be implemented in the form of JavaScript code, within the page that shows the QRCode, then the user-agent checks the status with a polling strategy in seconds or with a push strategy (eg: web socket). 

Since the QRcode page and the specialized endpoint are implemented by the Relying Party, it is under its responsability the implementation details of this solution, since it is related to the Relying Party's internal API. 

The Relyng Party MUST bind the request of the user-agent, with a Secured and Httponly session cookie, with the issued request (using the ``state`` parameter). The HTTP response returned by this specialized endpoint MAY contain the HTTP status codes listed below:

* **201 Created**. The signed request object was issued by the Relying Party that waits to be downloaded by the Wallet Instance at the **request_uri** endpoint.
* **202 Accepted**. This response is given when the signed request object was obtained by the Wallet Instance.
* **302 Found**. The Wallet Instance has sent the presentation to the Relying Party's  **redirect_uri** endpoint and the User authentication is successful. The Relying Party updates the session cookie allowing the user-agent to access to the protected resource. The ``Location`` within the HTTP Response allows the user-agent to leave the QRCode page.
* **403 Forbidden**. The Wallet Instance or its User have rejected the request, or the request is expired. The QRCode page SHOULD be updated with an error message.

Below a non normative example of how the HTTP Request to this specialized endpoint, that MUST carry the session cookie to be updated following the status of the authentication:

.. code::

  GET /session-state?state=3be39b69-6ac1-41aa-921b-3e6c07ddcb03
  HTTP/1.1
  HOST: verifier.example.org


Request Object Details
----------------------
The following actions are made by the Wallet Instance:

- scan the QR Code (Cross Device only);
- extract from the payload the ``request_uri`` parameter;
- invoke the retrieved URI;
- provide in the request its Wallet instance Attestation, using `DPOP`_ to proof the legitimate possession of it;
- obtain the signed request object from the Relying Party.

Below a non-normative example of HTTP request made by the Wallet Instance to the Relying Party to provide the Wallet Instance Attestion and retrieve the signed request object:

.. code-block:: javascript

  GET /request_uri HTTP/1.1
  HOST: verifier.example.org
  Authorization: DPoP $WalletInstanceAttestation
  DPoP: $WalletInstanceAttestationProofOfPossession


More detailed information about the `Wallet Instance Attestation`_ is available in its dedicated section of this technical specification.

To attest an high level of security, the Wallet Instance submits its Wallet Instance Attestation to the Relying Party, disclosing its capabilities and the security level attested by its Wallet Provider.

Herein the description of the parameters defined in *OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)*.

.. note::
    The use of DPoP doesn't represent any breaking changes to Wallet Instances that do not support DPoP to a *request_uri* endpoint, since it is assumed to use it as an additional security mechanisms for the attestation of the status of the Wallet Instance.

    If the DPoP HTTP Header is missing, the Relying Party would assume the lowest attestable level of security to the Wallet Instance it is interacting with.

DPoP HTTP Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **DPoP proof** is included in the request using the HTTP Header ``DPoP`` and containing a JWS. The JWS MUST be signed with the public key made available in the Wallet Instance Attestation (``Authorization: DPoP``).


The JOSE header of the **DPoP JWS** MUST contain at least the following parameters:

Here a non-normative example of ``presentation_definition``:


.. code-block:: JSON

  {
    "presentation_definition": {
      "id": "presentation definitions",
      "input_descriptors": [
        {
          "id": "pid-sd-jwt:unique_id+given_name+family_name",
          "name": "Person Identification Data",
          "purpose": "User authentication",

            "limit_discolusre": "preferred"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  

.. note::

  The following parameters, even if defined in [OID4VP], are not mentioned in the previous non-normative example, since their usage is conditional and may change in future release of this documentation.

  - ``presentation_definition``: JSON object according to `Presentation Exchange <https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/>`_. This parameter MUST not be present when ``presentation_definition_uri`` or ``scope`` are present.
  - ``presentation_definition_uri``: string containing an HTTPS URL pointing to a resource where a Presentation Definition JSON object can be retrieved. This parameter MUST be present when ``presentation_definition parameter`` or a ``scope`` value representing a Presentation Definition is not present.
  - ``client_metadata``: A JSON object containing the Verifier metadata values. The ``client_metadata`` parameter MUST NOT be present when ``client_id_scheme`` is ``entity_id``. The ``client_metadata`` is taken from ``trust_chain``.
  - ``client_metadata_uri``: string containing an HTTPS URL pointing to a resource where a JSON object with the Verifier metadata can be retrieved. The ``client_metadata_uri`` parameter MUST NOT be present when ``client_id_scheme`` is ``entity_id``.
  - ``redirect_uri``: the redirect URI to which the Wallet Instance MUST redirect the Authorization Response. This parameter MUST not be present when ``response_uri`` is present.


Authorization Response Details
------------------------------
After getting the User authorization and consent for the presentation of the credentials, the Wallet sends the Authorization Response to the Relying Party ``response_uri`` endpoint, the content should be encrypted according `OPENID4VP`_ Section 6.3, using the Relying Party public key.

.. note::
    **Why the response is encrypted?**

    The response sent from the Wallet Instance to the Relying Party is encrypted to prevent a malicious agent from gaining access to the plaintext information transmitted within the verifier's network. This is only possible if the network environment of the verifier employs `TLS termination <https://www.f5.com/glossary/ssl-termination>`_. Such technique employs a termination proxy that acts as an intermediary between the client and the webserver and handles all TLS-related operations. In this manner, the proxy deciphers the transmission's content and either forwards it in plaintext or by negotiates an internal TLS session with the actual webserver's intended target. In the first scenario, any malicious actor within the network segment could intercept the transmitted data and obtain sensitive information, such as an unencrypted response, by sniffing the transmitted data.

Below a non-normative example of the request:

.. code-block:: http

  POST /callback HTTP/1.1
  HOST: verifier.example.org
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  response=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIs...9t2LQ
  

Below is a non-normative example of the decrypted JSON ``response`` content:
